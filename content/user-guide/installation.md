#### This page is yet to be written, but for now, here is the legacy installation instructions for RocketMod:

<hr />

# Downloading RocketMod
We will start by downlading the lastest RocketMod build from [GitHub](../#). From here, download the `Rocket.Unturned.zip`, underneath `RocketMod Legacy #XXXX`.

Or alternatively, from [this](../#).

<hr />

# Installing RocketMod
Open your servers Unturned directory and go to the `Modules` folder. Extract the contents of the freshly downloaded zip to here.

After extracting start your server. The first start might take some time as RocketMod will download a bunch of other required files. After that, it will automatically create the required folders and files inside your `server` directory (`Unturned/servers/<yourserver>/Rocket`). You can now start [installing plugins](../#).
