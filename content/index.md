**Welcome to the community-written user documentation for Legally Distinct Missile!**

## Welcome

Legally Distinct Missile, is the official Smarty Dressed Games' **RocketMod** fork. In December of 2019, RocketMod, the most widely used plugin framework for Unturned multiplayer servers, was discontinued by its maintainers. *You can read their official farewell, and go more in-depth with an explanation, [here](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket/blob/master/Farewell.md).*

As RocketMod (now LDM), is still considered a necessity of hosting more-than-basic Unturned servers, we have decided to open up a Discord server, and this documentation, as an homage to the original RocketMod documentation and Discords, that provided the bulk of information and support for server owners. 

!!! question "Need help getting started?"
	If your just getting started with LDM, or have any questions, we highly suggest you [join our Discord.](https://discord.gg/ZhUJbRK)

## Installation

Assuming you already have a vanilla Unturned server running, either locally through SteamCMD, or through a 3rd party hosting provider, please follow the installation instructions, [here](../user-guide/installation).

If you don't have a server, read our **Getting Started with a New Server** guide, ~~here~~. (Coming soon)

<!-- RocketMod is an extensible .NET Game Server Plugin Framework.
It consists of two major parts - the Rocket Core - and special implementations of its API for .NET Games.
The implementations act as a simple wrapper around the game's core functionality and loads custom commands, configurations, and game objects. 
With a built-in permission system and growing plugin ecosystem, RocketMod aims to become the middleware between Games and Plugins altering their gameplay, following .NET Best Practices. 

This documentation contains useful information about how to **setup** a RocketMod server, but also covers basics in how to **develop** custom plugins for RocketMod. 
Feel free to extend or correct the documentation.

If you want do download the latest version of RocketMod, head over to the [RocketMod GitHub release page](https://github.com/RocketMod/Rocket.Unturned/releases).
