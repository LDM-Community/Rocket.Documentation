## Installing plugins on your server

As official Rocket plugins Harbor has been closed, you now have to look for plugins to download elsewhere. You can try finding them by searching for `unturned plugin` on Github.com Then You can download the latest release of the plugin like shown in the picture below

However some plugins' repositories don't have releases then you have to build a plugin yourself.  
All plugins' git repos, that were on **Rocket Harbor**, are listed on [Reddit Repository List](https://www.reddit.com/r/rocketmod/comments/ek4i7b/list_of_plugins_from_the_old_repository/)
